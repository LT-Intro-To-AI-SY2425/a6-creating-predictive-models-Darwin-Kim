# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

Low income, Low spending: "Safe" - Since they don't make a lot of money, they choose to save what they do have

Low income, High spending: "Gamblers" - They may be trying to make more money by investing what they have

Medium income: "Par" - They are the baseline, the control variable.

High income, Low spending: "Savers" - They have a lot of money, but they don't like to spend it

High income, High spending: "Money in, Money out" - They get money, they spend it
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

Although there were no people like that on this graph according to the clusters, if there were I would call them "Cautious".

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

To me, the group that interests me the most is the middle class. The people within the middle class are mildly interested in less important things such as fun and entertainment, however they also need a reason why making that decision would make their lives easier.
